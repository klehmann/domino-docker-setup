Download the Domino 10 app dev pack beta, extract it in this directory and ensure it's named "ibm_domino_V10_appdev_pack_V1.0_linux64_beta.tar".

You should also extract the tar file locally, because it includes the file "domino-appdev-docs-site.tgz", which is a ZIP file containing the documentation.
